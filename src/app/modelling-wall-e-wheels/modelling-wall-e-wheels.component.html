        <p>Welcome to this session.</p>
        <p>
          Today we are going to have a look at the Wheels part of our robot. Similar to the Body before, the structure looks more 
          complicated than it really is. For the most part we are going to use basic shapes again and re-define them afterwards. For 
          instance you may already see that the wheel track is made out of several cubes and the inner individual wheels are probably 
          made out of cylinders.
        </p>
        <p>
          This said we are going to start placing some cylinders in the exact locations of the circles ignoring the details for now. 
          Again you can just rotate the cylinder by 90 degrees on the x-axis (either manually or typing it in) and then scale it down 
          to cover our reference image. The rest of the cylinders can just be duplicated with <strong>SHIFT + D</strong> or 
          <strong>CTRL + C</strong> and <strong>CTRL + V</strong> from the first one and scaled accordingly. Watch out that you only 
          scale with the blue rectangle symbol, so that the local X and Y-coordinates are scaled but not the local Z-coordinates. 
          Otherwise the cylinders will have different widths when looking from the front of the robot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that the cylinders are defined, we are detailing them. For the wheels I have used two quite similar but different designs, 
          you may also create your own if you want. Since we won't really look at the inside part of the wheel, we are just focusing on 
          detailing one side. First select the outer face of the first cylinder and use the Inset tool with <strong>I</strong> to create 
          two inner circles. Make the second one quite small. Then select all of the inner faces, remember that you can use the select 
          brush with <strong>C</strong> to easily help you do that. With <strong>E</strong> we are extruding the faces inwards to create 
          an indentation. Then we move the inner circle a bit outwards using <strong>G</strong> to move and <strong>Z</strong> to fix the 
          axis. Then extrude the small circle a tiny bit. The first wheel is done and can be colored with the already defined Rust_Brown 
          color. Repeat the same process for the next two wheels. You can also just duplicate the second one to create the third. For 
          the last two wheels we are going to use a different design but the same methods again. Here I make sure that the larger wheel 
          is behind the smaller one, so that we have some 3D variety.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the next wheels which are also going to be the wheels that will be able to rotate later on, we create three inner circles 
          with the Inset tool. The inner circle will be a bit larger this time. Extrude the first inner ring a bit, then repeat the 
          process we used before for the inner faces by extruding them inwards and moving the inner part a bit outside along the local 
          Z axis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only detail missing on the dynamic wheels now are the spikes. To create them we first create a new tiny cube and place it 
          on top of the wheel. Then we are moving the upper inner points with X-Ray toggled on to the inside to create a sharp slope, 
          repeat this for the side view too. Coloring it with Rust_Brown we almost are done already.
        </p>
        <p>
          The easiest way of creating the spiked around the wheel is to use the Array Modifier we have seen before. But this time we 
          want to move the array also around a curve, specifically a curve in the shape of a circle. To do this we first have to create 
          a Bezier Circle, by adding it to the scene. Save yourself half an hour by choosing the correct object, we want the circle 
          from the curve menu, not the 2D circle from the geometries. They are not the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you aligned the Bezier Circle with the wheel you can go back to the Spike object and go to the modifier selection. Add 
          the Array Modifier first, selecting roughly 16 as the count and then add the Curve Modifier. Here you have to select our 
          Bezier Curve. Then you only have to adjust your settings and maybe move the spikes a bit to locate them to their final position. 
          To make sure that your spikes are distributed equally one trick is to try to overlap the first and last spike and then toggling 
          on the Merge-option so that they merge together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before applying the modifiers as we usually do, duplicate the two objects we just used to define the spike ring: The spike and 
          the circle. Then move them to the other wheel where we also want to use this design. I also duplicated it again to have the 
          spikes on the back half of the first wheel because that looked nicer. If you have placed all the objects accordingly, you 
          can apply the modifiers. If you have done that, you may also want to delete the circles since we won't need them anymore. 
          You can now also join the spike rings with their according wheel, but leave the spiked wheels as individual objects since we 
          want to rotate them in the animation later. The static not-spiked wheels also can be joined together.
        </p>
        <p>
          To finish the inner wheel part, we only have to connect the wheel parts so that they don't look like seperate objects. For this 
          we can just use a cube and create some kind of rail. Here I just extruded both sides of a cube and than moved the outer 
          points a bit to match the reference. Color the object acordingly to the wheels and combine the static wheel part.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we go to the front view and take care of what can be considered the legs of the robot. Therefore we Inset the face of the 
          first cylinder facing inwards and then extruding the circle until the first edge. We extrude again until the next edge, this 
          time we also scale the resulting circle smaller and move it up a bit, then we extrude it again to finish the first leg part.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second part has to be a new object since we want to move them independently afterwards. We can start with a cylinder again 
          for this one and then just extrude and scale the circle again. Here I missed to move the second leg part to the front on top 
          of the other one, so that they connect to each other. I will notice this later on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only thing missing now is the Wheel track that is going to move around the whole thing. To create the first track part I want 
          to use the Mirror modifier. For this reason I make the rest of the scene invisible so that I can work in the center of the world. 
          First I create another cube and scale it roughly in the form that the tracks should have: rectangular with a small depth. Then I 
          am using the mirror modifier from the start to model the object. So I don't have to draw the pattern I am going to use twice. 
          I want to create something like a W-looking shape for the pattern with indentations on the side. To create the lines I am going 
          to use Loop-Cuts and for the finer details and non-straight lines the Knife tool. First we want to create an indentation on the 
          end of the face. After creating two lines use the Extrude tool to indent inwards, toggling "dissolving orthogonal edges" again 
          to clear unwanted fragments. Then we use four straight vertical lines, two  diagonal lines and two straight lines to cut out 
          a symbol roughly looking like a wheel track pattern. Then select the pattern and extrude it outwards a bit. Apply the modifier, 
          add the Rust_brown color and the wheel track part is done. Now we only have to duplicate it around the inner wheel mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this we are going to use the same trick as we did before with the spikes and the wheel. You may want to pause the video now 
          and try it for yourself to test your learned skills. We will proceed in a second.
        </p>
        <p>
          As before we create a Bezier Circle and move it roughly around the inner wheel parts. The only difference to before is that now 
          we have to adjust the curve to fit  our reference. Go into the Edit mode and try to adjust the points of the curve along with 
          the according control points. You may want to subdivide some of the lines to get another point to work with.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you are happy with your curve, you can go into the modifier menu of the track part and add the Array and the Curve Modifier. 
          In the end I used roughly 20 parts with a very tiny offset just over 1. This time we don't want to apply the modifiers since we 
          need them to turn our wheeltrack. You can try it now for yourself: By moving the track along the X-axis the wheeltrack is 
          rotating around the curve achieving the effect we want. 
        </p>
        <p>
          One side is finished now. At this point make sure to properly name all of the objects, I added "Right" at the end of the name, 
          to make the seperation clear for later.  Here we could use the mirror modifier again for every object, but then we would have to 
          manually seperate each object again if we want to seperate the Left and the Right side. Another option, the one I choose, is to 
          select all the objects that have to be mirrored, duplicate them and then mirror them directly on the global axis. Clicking with 
          the right mouse button and choosing Mirror: Global Y-Axis, then just move them to their correct position. In the end make sure 
          to name everything properly and use collections to order your project to have a good overview. As you can see the wheels are 
          now done. Next time we will prepare the Head of the Wall-e robot.
