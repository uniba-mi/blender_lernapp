        <p>Welcome to this final session.</p>
        <p>
          Today we are going to rig our Wall-E robot and create an animation. Let's start by selecting our robot collection and adding 
          an armature. This will automatically create a bone with it from the start. We now want to display the bone in front of 
          everything to make the rig easier to work with. This can be changed in the viewport display options.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current bone we use as the starting point for our rig, the parent bone which controls all the others. Specifically here 
          it will be used to control the Body. Because we want to add the neck bone in the next step, we are now going to extend the 
          bone by moving the joint upwards. Similar to before we can just use the Extrude tool or the shortcut <strong>E</strong> to 
          create another bone from the current joint and place it again in the center. Repeat this again for the top neck part. 
          Automatically the new bones are always attached to their parent bone, so if you move the parent bone the children are 
          moving with it. This behavior is called forward kinematics.
        </p>
        <p>
          As discussed before we also want to create a bone for each of the eyes so we can move them independently. Currently the bones 
          are not attached to the mesh. So if you move them nothing happens. We will change that after defining the rest of the rig.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we are done with the head we want to create some new bones that are not directly attached to the other bones. Just 
          add another bone manually, we will take care of the parenting in the next step. For now we create the bone for the arm. If 
          you want to make sure that everything is aligned horizontally you can adjust the values of the head and tail joints directly. 
          Here I already duplicated the arm bone before I realized that I can also just create all the bones necessary and then duplicate 
          the whole arm and hand. Since we wanted to only differentiate between the back finger or thumb and the front fingers, we only 
          need two bone threads coming from the main arm joint. The finger joints can be placed on top of the cylinders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that I realize that I can duplicate my process I delete the arm on the right again and just use <strong>SHIFT + D</strong> 
          on the whole arm selected and move the new arm over to the other side. To connect the arms to our main bone, select the main 
          arm bone first and then the main bone, then use the shortcut <strong>CTRL + P</strong> to make a parent or like me who forgot 
          the shortcut use right click and click on <strong>Parent->Make</strong> and keep the offset. You can now see the dotted line 
          signaling the connection and the offset. If you want to test if your rig is correctly set up so far, you may go into the Pose 
          Mode and move the main bone. If the bones are set up correctly they should all move with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we want to take care of the wheels. You may want to pause and test if you can do this yourself already. We proceed in a second.
        </p>
        <p>
          We add a new bone like before and set the tail joint to the upper leg beginning, the head joint at the end of the cylinder. 
          Then we can extrude another bone to the wheel which will hold all the main parts of the wheel. Then we only have to add two 
          more bones for the two wheels that we want to rotate later. These ones have to be seperate bones again and will be then 
          attached to the wheel bone we just created. Like before select the child first and then the parent before making the parent 
          connection, again choose to keep the offset. For the wheel on the left side, we can just duplicate the whole frame again. 
          Just mirror it by the global Y axis again and move it to its location. Now we are finished with the rig. The next step will 
          be to attach it to the mesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          To do this select the relevant object which you want to add to a bone, here I forgot to also add our display light along with 
          the body. Then select the rig and change your mode from the object mode to the pose mode. Select the relevant bone in the 
          Pose mode and use the shortcut <strong>CTRL + P</strong> to set the bone as the parent for the mesh. You can test if it worked 
          correctly by moving the bone. Now the Body should move with our main bone. We now repeat this process for every object and 
          bone which we want to connect. So the bottom neck to the bottom neck bone the upper neck to the upper neck bone and so on. 
          You should test your model while connecting to make sure everything is set up correctly. For the wheel part watch out that you 
          attach the static wheel parts, the wheel track and the bezier curve of the track to the wheel bone so that everything will move 
          with it. The rotating wheels will be connected to the according bones which are already attached to the wheel bone, so you 
          don't have to attach them directly. Repeat the same for the left wheel.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing which can be useful for animating later is to create a pose library, so I quickly show how to use that. Select the 
          amature and go to the Pose Library, create a new one. Select all the relevant bones when adding a new pose, the current 
          positioning will be the pose. So this one can be called the "Default". For another pose we could create a sad Wall-E face by 
          rotating the eye bones. Select the relevant bones after changing them and create a new Pose for them, I called it "Sad". If 
          you want to apply a pose use the magnifying glass on the right of the Pose Library. We won't use them for our animation but 
          this can be a powerful tool to work with.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing you don't necessarily have to to, but can help very much in animating your figure is to use constraints to limit 
          certain transformations of the bones. For example the eyes should not be able to rotate around the whole axis but only at 
          a limited angle. So we can add a bone constraint similar to the modifiers we are used to. Make sure to work in the local 
          space otherwise things behave weird really fast. On the eyes I limited the X axis rotation to -15 up to 15 degrees the other 
          rotations I constrained to zero, so I can not use them at all. I now constrain most of the bones rotations here, this is 
          mostly a process of try and error. Another constraint you may want to use on the upper neck is the Copy rotation constraint 
          which can be inverted. So the rotation of the bottom neck is always automatically adjusted on the top. I will later delete 
          this again here because it prevents the robot from looking up which I want to use in the animation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then left out the arms on purpose because we won't use them for our animation. If you want to set them up too, you may 
          want to use a path constraint for the arm so that it follows the track. The constraint for the moving wheels is very easy, 
          it is only allowed to move in one axis rotation and the other wheel can then just copy the rotation from it. Here I forgot 
          to set the owner to local space which I will notice later on, please use the local space here. For the wheel and leg bone 
          you can use the same trick with the inverted copy rotation again if you want to use that. Now the rig is set up for us and 
          all that is left to do is to create our animation.
        </p>
        <p>
          For our animation I want to use the perspective to trick the viewer. First the robot should drive into the scene and see a 
          really big plant, then it goes out of the frame and when it comes back we see that it was actually just far away and is now 
          as big or bigger as the plant. Here I am trying to figure out how far away the robot has to be placed and in which angle the 
          camera should be placed for a good effect. I want the robot to be on a similar height to the plant when he drives to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are happy with your positioning you may also want to go to the Animation workspace wich is much more ideal to work 
          with for animations. Now we have to define what our first frame should look like. Here the robot is suposed to be out of 
          frame. To set the first keyframe of the animation select all the bones and press the shortcut <strong>I</strong> to insert 
          a keyframe. Here you can specifically choose what transformation you are changing, for our purpose we can just always 
          choose selected bones because we mostly only use one form of transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can now see that you created some points in the dope sheet below. Here all keyframes are listed and you can see which 
          bones and which transforms are affected by it. For example if you have a keyframe of a bone in one position and then a 
          second one further in the future at another position the bone will interpolate between the keyframes so a moving animation 
          is created. For our first scene we want the robot to move inside the camera view and then stop, so we have to insert a new 
          keyframe at the stop. Then you can already watch what the animation would look like. Here I am ignoring the wheels for now 
          on purpose those will be the last thing for us to animate.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the robot stopped we want it to look at the plant, kind of scanning it from bottom to top, confused by how large it is. 
          So first we want to adjust the neck bones so that the robot is looking down. here I delete the copy rotation constraint 
          which I talked about before because it was preventing the robot to look down. With our neck bones selected we insert new 
          keyframes with I then again a new position where the robot looks up, inserting another keyframe. When there is no movement 
          between two keyframes this is shown in the dope sheet by marking a dark connection between the two. For example I duplicated 
          the keyframes from the middle of the animation because there was a pause missing after looking down. With the pause the 
          animation seemed more reasonable to how a human or animal would behave. Here i tried to figure out why one of the keyframes 
          did not move with thes rest until I realised that this marked a bone that I had not selected at the moment. After I 
          duplicated the keyframes again the animation worked as expected. Also note that if you need more frames for the animation 
          go to the Properties Panel and adjust the number that represents the end frame number.
        </p>
        <p>
          After looking at the plant the robot should look at the viewer and break the 4th wall. Here I wanted to have the robot 
          look sad or confused by rotating the eyes a bit down. After that the robot should just drive out of the scene. The whole 
          process basically is always the same. Sometimes you have to adjust some keyframes because you forgot to select the according 
          bones or suddenly you move a bone that you didn't keyframe before so the animation does not begin where you expect it to. 
          Now that we defined the first scene, we want to have the next scene where the robot is suddenly big.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically you could now appruply translate the robot to the new position and keyframe it because it is outside of the 
          camera view. For no reason whatsover I decided to have a realistic turn around a driving sequence here.
        </p>
        <p>
          After having the robot at the starting point of the next scene, we want it to drive into the view of the camera, stop, 
          look at the plant again, then to the viewer and then we try to let the robot communicate that its happy or amused. This 
          is almost the same process as before so you may want to try it yourself. For the amused animation at the end I tried to do 
          something like a wink with the eyes by moving them down and the up in a quick manner. This then marks the end of the 
          animation. For the rest I just added the moving parts of the wheel. For the wheels itself I used a -360 degree rotation 
          from start to stop for all two scenes. I repeated that on the other side. Then for the wheel track we have to go into the 
          object mode when editing because we have not defined a bone. The animation will use our modifiers that are still defined 
          in the object. We can just move the wheel track along the bezier circle we defined and it will look like it is rotating in 
          a circle while we actually move the position of the track along one axis. Like before we define the keyframes after moving. 
          Just try to match the start and stop points of the robot moving.
        </p>
        <p>
          When happy with the animation we only have to adjust our output format, here choosing FFmpeg Video, defining a folder to 
          save the video and depending on how long you want to wait for the result, you may want to turn down the amount of render 
          iterations. Then just use the menu on top to render the animation and wait until Blender is finished.
        </p>
        <p>Here you can see the final result.</p>
