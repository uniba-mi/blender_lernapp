<h2 id="headline">Theory: Curves</h2>
<div id="start_content">
    <p>In this theory chapter we will briefly talk about the theory of curves to get a basic understanding on what they are, how they 
        could be created in Blender in specific and what they can be used for. There are two types of curves available in Blender that 
        can also be found in any other 3D modelling tool, namely Bezier Curves and Nurbs which are both heavily used for CGI and CAD 
        applications.

    <p>The image above displays a very simple Bezier Curve. As you can see the curve consists of two endpoints. In addition there 
        can be multiple control points between them which are used to determine the overall shape of the curve. For each of those points 
        there are handles that are used for editing the curve. I will not go into the mathematical details here. In case you are 
        interested please take a look <a href=" https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BezierCurve.html" target="_blank">

    <h3>NURBS(Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines)</h3>

    <p>
        On the first sight they look pretty similar. In fact NURBS curves can be seen as a generalisation of Bezier curves. 
        They are especially good for the creation of organic models since they can be used for surfaces. The shape of these curves 
        is determined by multiple control vertices to which the curve is pulled. By for example extruding one curve along another, 
        surfaces can be created which then at render time will be converted into polygons. Their points are therefore determined by 
        the weighted sum of control points.
