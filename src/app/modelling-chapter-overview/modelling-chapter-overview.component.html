        While the first chapter was all about exploring Blender and playing around with it, in this chapter we will focus on one 
        complex model to add a set of new skills and techniques to work on bigger models. For this purpose I picked the Wall-E robot 
        and a little plant that will be modelled over several lections. Using some reference material I will show you all the steps to 
        go from a simple model made from simple geometries to a more detailed one. We will be learning how to use modifiers and tools in 
        Blender appropriatly and how they can help us to achieve complex tasks relatively easy. As the chapter progresses you will also 
        learn more about the inner structure of models and how they are build up. Furthermore we will also talk about the basics of adding 
        in materials and textures in the third part and how they can help us to make our model look more realistic. Below you can see an 
        image of the Wall-E robot and the little plant we are building during this chapter.

        This chapter is meant to be more of a follow along session. In the different chapters I will show you the different steps I took 
        starting from scratch to build the model you see in this image. At the top of each chapter you will find a brief description 
        of what you can expect to see in the video. At any time during this section feel free to spend some more time on the model. Reflect 
        what I just showed and think about other ways of achieving what was done in the video. Add in some more details or shape. In 
        general the model is kept as simple as possible to reduce the video time.
