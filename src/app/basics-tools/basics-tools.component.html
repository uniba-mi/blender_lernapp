        <p>Welcome to this session.</p>
        <p>
          Today I want to show you some basic tools in Blender. You will learn how to use the Edit Mode and learn 
          the difference to the Object Mode we saw in the last session.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's first go into the Layout view. We will refresh some basic operations. Transform the figure back to 
          it's normal position and move it up, out of the way. Then build a little plattform for the figure and move 
          the plattform up until it's roughly standing on the XY-plane. Then place the figure on top of it. You may 
          want to stop the video and try it for yourself. The solution follows shortly.
        </p>
        <p><u>Solution:</u></p>
        <p>
          Set all transforms to zero. Use the move tool. We will build a little table as a plattform. Add a new cube 
          and scale it wide to the side and scale it small in its height. Then we add another cube and scale it in the 
          form of a tables leg. Copy the leg three times, place it at the right position and combine all the objects to 
          one. Then move both objects to its final position.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we will select the figure and inspect it inside the Edit Mode. Until now we have only transformed the whole 
          objects, now we will go inside of one object and modify it's mesh. To switch between different granularity of 
          the view, select the wanted option in the new menu in the left corner. You will notice that we can now see all 
          the vertices, edges and faces within an object and you probably can guess that we can modify each of them. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As stated in the last session we will now have a look at the X-Ray option again. In normal view you can select 
          each vertex,edge or face you can see. In the X-Ray mode you can select even the ones hidden on the backside or 
          inside of an object.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we will learn our new tools waiting at the left side, we will first see how we can handle the mesh and 
          even fix broken meshes. For that we go into the Face selection mode and click at the top face of the figure. 
          Than we press the right mouse button and find the option to delete the face. Now we can see the inside of our figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Go now into the vertex selection mode and select two points. This counts as the same action as selecting an 
          edge in the edge selection. Now click the right mouse button and click on subdivide, a new vertex will appear 
          between the other ones. Do the same thing on the other side. We can now create our own edge by selecting the 
          two new points and pressing <strong>F</strong>. If you would have selected at least three points or (equivalent 
          to a face) then <strong>F</strong> will create a new face. We will do this now for left and the right side here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we have two faces at the top. To merge them together, we can just dissolve the vertices we just created, so 
          that we have the same face as it was at the beginning. With this knowledge you can fix a mesh if there are any 
          issues (for example after using some modifiers).
        </p>
        <p>
          In Edit Mode you have the same "Add" option as before but it does not behave equally. If you add an object in 
          the Object Mode, it will be a seperate object. But if you add it in the Edit Mode, it will automatically belong 
          to this object and will be counted as part of it's mesh and local axis. If you want to merge objects together 
          into one, you can use a shortcut we used before. With <strong>CTRL + J</strong> you join objects together. This 
          is equivalent to just adding all the objects within the Edit Mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's now go back into the Object Mode and create six copies of our figure. Place them in front of our main figure. 
          You can make the ones invisible that you are currently not modifying by unchecking their visibility in the 
          scene collection.
        </p>
        <p><u>Extrude:</u></p>
        <p>(See manual: <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/editing/face/extrude_faces.html">here</a>)</p>
        <p>
          Starting with the first figure, we want to learn the Extrude tool. To use this tool, we will first select a 
          face and then select the tool or press the shortcut <strong>E</strong>. When you now move the mouse up, you basically 
          drag the face along the normal vector of the face and create four new points. When you have the face selected you can also 
          scale it by clicking <strong>S</strong>. If you use these two tools you can easily create your first custom designs. 
          For example we will create a hat for this figure.
        </p>
        <p><u>Inset:</u></p>
        <p>(See manual: <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/editing/face/inset_faces.html">here</a>)</p>
        <p>
          The next tool is the Inset tool. This one helps you to create new faces facing inwards of an face. Easier to show 
          than to explain this one, press the shortcut I after selcting the front face or the equivalent tool on the left side. 
          Than you can define how far inside you want to create a new inner face. Also here, four new points are created. 
          Combining this tool with extruding we can create an indentation. You can also do the same by insetting twice and then 
          moving the points inside.
        </p>
        <p><u>Bevel:</u></p>
        <p>(See manual: <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/editing/edge/bevel.html">here</a>)</p>
        <p>
          The Bevel tool is very helpful to create rounded corners. This time we will select all cube faces or all vertices 
          of the cube. To use the Bevel tool you can use the shortcut <strong>CTRL + B</strong>. If you scroll with the mouse 
          wheel more points can be added to the corners. More points create a smoother surface.
        </p>
        <p><u>Loop Cut:</u></p>
        <p>(See manual: <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/tools/loop.html">here</a>)</p>
        <p>
          Sometimes you need to make a cut around the whole object. In these cases you want to use the Loop Cut. You can use 
          it with the shortcut <strong>CRTL + R</strong>. Similar to bevel you can influence the behavior of the tool with 
          the mouse wheel. By scrolling you add more cuts to the object. For our cube figure we want to create two cuts at 
          the top and two cuts at the bottom. The should ach be very near to each other. Then we go into the ortographic 
          front view, toogle on the X-Ray and select the upper part of the cube. Move it to the side and adjust the points. 
          Do the same things but to the other side on the bottom.
        </p>
        <p><u>Knife:</u></p>
        <p>(See manual: <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/tools/knife.html">here</a>)</p>
        <p>
          Watch out. This figure will be very scary. Not only do we work with the Knife tool, but also will we use the figure 
          as kind of a halloween pumpkin. The shortcut for the Knife is the <strong>key K</strong>. Contrary to the loop cut, 
          the knife only cuts one side in the dafult configuration which you can see in the Tool panel. You can now use it 
          to cut whatever you want into the front face of the cube. Press <strong>Enter</strong> to cut the drawn lines out. 
          If you want to use straight lines use the <strong>key A</strong> (* was changed to A). With the constraint mode you 
          can cut straight according to your current view. So the best option is to be in the orthographic side view when 
          using it. In the end you can use Extrude to finish your pumpkin face.
        </p>
        <p><u>Merge:</u></p>
        <p>(See manual: <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/editing/mesh/merge.html">here</a>)</p>
        <p>
          The last and most easy tool is the Merge operation. For this just select any points you want to merge and press 
          <strong>M</strong>. You will have several options how you want to merge them. We will merge them at the center. 
          Sometimes its also useful to merge points by distance if they almost overlap each other. If you want you can 
          use the merge tool again on the arms of the figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can now go back to the Object mode and see the whole family of figures we created. Next time we will extend to 
          family to their modifier cousins.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Task:</u> If you want an extra challenge: Try to create your own figure using every tool we learned in this session.
