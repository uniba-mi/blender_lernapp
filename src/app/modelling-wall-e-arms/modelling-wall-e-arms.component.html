        <p>Welcome to this session.</p>
        <p>
          Today we are going to finish the model of the robot and build some arms and hands. Let's start by going into the side view 
          and creating some kind of rectangular connecting piece, which is supossed to follow the track path of the Body. So we place 
          it in there. Then we are going to add a cylinder which will connect to it. You may place it back to the center of the world 
          if you want to quickly detail it and then mirror it to the other side. If you are done with the circulare faces, place it back 
          to the final position. Then add two cuts around the object with the Loop Cut tool or the shortcut <strong>CTRL + R</strong>. 
          Similar to the technique used with the binoculars detail, we can select the faces around the cylinder with <strong>ALT</strong> 
          and left mouse click and then scale it outwards. Since we are scaling in every direction here, I adjusted the form after 
          that by scaling on the Z-axis, so that we don't have a concave shape here. Then just color the faces accordingly yellow 
          and in the metal color.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next we are adding the rectangular arm which is just a long-sided cube with some details drawn on one side. I tried to match 
          roughly the size of the metal plate behind it here. After done positioning the cube, just add some lines with the knife tool, 
          making sure just to select and cut on the outer side of the arm. Then we want to color it alternating between a white and black 
          color. Before adding the metal pole connecting to the hand of the robot I add another little circular ring that I bevel, this 
          time even with the bevel modifier. This just makes the look more realistic. Then as mentioned before we add a cylindric pole 
          connecting to the arm and having the standard rust Metal color. For the detail ring before I used the dark metal color to have 
          some variance in there. Also to differentiate a bit here, I want to use a metal and rusty metal color for the hand, using the 
          rust parts for the connecting cylindric parts and the metal parts for the finger parts. For the cylinder parts here you can 
          just use duplication and then readjust the objects a bit. Basically we will have two fingers in the front and one thumb-like 
          finger in the back. To simplify our robot I assumed that the robot can only move his front fingers together as one, so we don't 
          have too much independent objects in the end. Also we differentiate between an upper and lower part of the fingers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are done preparing the cylinders, we are going to have to create a few a little bit more complicated finger parts before 
          we are finally done. At this point if the rotation of the reference picture is confusing you too much, you can always just 
          rotate it to match your current work again.
        </p>
        <p>
          First we start with the connecting piece at the back of the hand. For this we start by adding a cube and scaling it to our needs. 
          I oriented myself here by looking at the cylinder which will end up being somewhere in the center of our new object. 
          After positioning we just select two of the outer edges and bevel them so that we have an almost similar shape to the reference. 
          For detailing purposes we are now going to cut out a piece from the middle of the object, so that the cylinder can be seen 
          fully. Here I just extruded the inner face a bit because I realised I need more space. When you are happy with your positioning 
          of your connector object and the cut-out object, you can use the Boolean Modifier on the connector object, choosing difference 
          and applying the cut. You may delete the cut-out object. I just made it invisible to use it again for the next few cut-outs we 
          are going to need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically we are going to repeat the process now for the rest of the parts, each having a bit of a different shape. For the 
          first upper finger part: Adding a cube, scaling and positoning it. Here I used bevel to create some more vertices to create 
          the appropriate form, you could also just use Extrude and scaling here which would probably be a bit easier. At the finger 
          start again, we use bevel to round the corners accordingly to the reference. Then the last part is to cut out a tiny pice 
          at the inner upper side. here I use again my cut-out cube which I rotated accordingly. After creating the first finger part, 
          you can just mirror it to the other side. Then you may also already join the upper hand half to one object, as this all may 
          move together in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the lower finger part we add again a cube and adjust the points. Then just mirror it again, and coloring it with the 
          metal color. In the end you may just join the lower parts together too.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only thing left now, is the thumb part in the back. As we are going to repeat the same process, you can try to test your 
          skills practically and stop the video for now. We will proceed in a second.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the thumb, you can just duplicate the lower part of the finger as this is practically identical. Then for the upper half, 
          we have to assume a fitting shape. I decided to make it even simpler than the front ones by sticking to the four vertices and 
          then bevel the upper half accordingly. In the end we have to repeat a similar cut-out as before but on the outer sides of the 
          object. You may add the cut-out in the boolean modifier and make it invisible so that you can see how the cut-out would look 
          without having it applied yet. If you are satisfied apply the modifiers, join all parts that should move togther together and 
          then proceed by naming your objects accordingly. The right arm is done now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we are selecting all of the objects and duplicating them to the left side, mirroring it again by the Y axis. Then clean 
          your project by naming and structuring it again. 
        </p>
        <p>
          A last look and see, we have finished the Wall-e model. Next time we create the plant standing next to the robot and then we 
          can start texturing in the session after that.
