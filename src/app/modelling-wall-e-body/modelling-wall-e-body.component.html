        <p>Welcome to this session.</p>
        <p>
          Today we will start to work on our main project in this learning environment. For this project we will create one of the cutest 
          robots from a computer-animated science fiction film: WALL-E. You can find the necessary ressources, the reference images, 
          attached. We will use them shortly.
        </p>
        <p>
          First we start a new project in Blender, starting with the default scene prepared for us. The first thing we are going to do is 
          to add the reference images so that we have a good idea on what to expect from our modeling. To do that there are basically 
          three ways and it does not matter which one you choose: You can either go to <strong>Add->Image</strong> and add your image as 
          a reference image from a folder, or do the same thing as a background image. The third way that I am going to take is to just 
          drag the image from the folder to the scene. The only difference between these approaches are the default settings they will 
          start with. Since we are going to look at them soon and change them to our needs, it does not matter how you include it in 
          the project. One thing to note is that the image will always be included in the scene parallel to your current view, so make 
          sure to go into the orthographic view before including the image. You can also rotate,move and scale it afterwards if you want to.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first picture to include is the front of WALL-E, as you can see the main body is almost prepared for us with the starting 
          cube. The settings I talked about before can be found withing the property panel in the image tab. We can choose wether we 
          want the image to be like an object or always in front or always in the back. I will go with "always front" and later change 
          the opacity and visibility as needed. You can also decide wether you want the image to be seen from only the front or also the 
          back, and in which perspectives it is seen. I think the easiest workflow is to just see the side pictures in the orthographic 
          view and only from the front, since I have prepared pictures for all sides. In the end I set the opcaity on, so that I can see 
          our cube trough the picture. Now I will add the side pictures for all orthographic views and scale them so that they will fit 
          to the bottom side of the cube. Prepare the workspace as it seems easiest to you, maybe you will find it easier to have the 
          images next to your cube instead than on top of it. The last image I want to add is a perspective one, so we can also add it 
          in a perspective view so that we can later compare the reference to the model if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we prepared our workspace to our needs, we can start working on the WALL-E Body. First we want to move the points 
          from the top a bit lower since the robots cube is a bit wider than it is tall. To make our modeling easier we want to add a 
          color to our cube, so that we can later separate different regions better. The colours are just a substitute for now and we 
          will redefine them later when we talk about shading and texturing, however please make sure that you use your defined colors 
          consistently and name them appropriatly so that you dont have to adjust them manually later. We will name the first color 
          "Rust_Yellow" which will be the main color of our robot. For now you can choose a brownish yellow for that or even use the 
          eye dropper to just copy the color from the reference image.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we want to seperate the metallic part on top from the bottom part. Since we need the same line also on the sides we can 
          use the Loop-Cut tool here or respectivally the shortcut <strong>CTRL + R</strong>. If you want a closed circle the loop-cut 
          is good for making a cut around the whole object. To move the line click the mouse button down and keep it pressed until 
          your are satisfied with the position. I accidently misclicked and added another horizontal line which is not necesarry here. 
          Since we now have a seperate area, we add another color, name it "Metal" and make it grey and a bit metallic in the settings. 
          To add it to the region, select the face and assign the color you just created to it.  To indent the upper area we can use 
          the Extrude tool with the shortcut <strong>E</strong>. A problem you will notice is that it will create walls that should not 
          be there, to prevent that go to the options after you used the shortcut and click on "dissolve orthogonal edges". 
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I noticed that our scene structure is a bit chaotic, so I named the images appropriatly and moved them inside a new 
          collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you now look closely at the front, you can see that the middle upper part is yellow again, so one way of fixing this is 
          to create a new area there. For this I am using the knife tool to cut from one edge to another one. Here you have to look 
          closely at the settings in the tool bar. There are three options: If "Occlude geometry" is on the knife will only cut the 
          front-most geometry. If we want to cut here from the orthographic front there are two edges before each other, so this 
          setting will not work as expected. Another way is to tick the second option "Only Selected" and then select the face you want 
          to cut. Then you will always cut through the correct face. To make a straight cut, use the shortcut <strong>C</strong> while 
          having the knife selected (* Note here: The shortcut changed to C). To make the cut final press <strong>Enter</strong> to 
          confirm it. If you created the new area, assign the yellow color to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To finish the front side for now, we add a new cube in the Object Mode, move it to the front and scale it to the right size. 
          We can use the upper front edge to set the slope. Adjust the edge or the two vertices. Also assign the metal color to the 
          cube. You can now join the objects together. We call the resulting object the "Body" for now.
        </p>
        <p>
          After finishing the first part of the front side, we will now take care of the sides. Analysing the image we can see that the 
          upper metal part of the front extends further to the back, the yellow main body has an indentation at the upper half seperated 
          by a skewed line. There is a brown track drawn with an indentation where the arm can move along later.
        </p>
        <p>
          To model the side we use a similar trick as before. Select the knife tool and trace the lines from the image. First we want 
          to cut out the metal part. Don't forget to select the face first and check your tool settings. Press <strong>Enter</strong> 
          if you want to finalize the cut. Next we do the same thing for the brown track. Try to be careful at the last cut line since 
          we want the vertices to connect and the edges to form a circle. Now select the yellow face and add the skewed line. We are 
          now finished with cutting and can now fill in the colors. Again we use the same "Metal" color and assign it to the two faces. 
          For the brown track we have to create a new color we want to call "Rust_Brown". To finish the rough shape we use the shortcut 
          <strong>E</strong> for extrude again and indend the upper yellow part, then we do the same for the brown track. At the end 
          we add a cylinder, color it yellow, scale it to the correct size and move it to the right spot. Join the objects to the "Body". 
        </p>
        <p>
          And then we are half finished. Since we have only done one side yet. For this instance we can use another trick. We are 
          going to halve our "Body" object in two and mirror our progress to the other side. To do the split we could use either the 
          loop cut tool twice, since the box in the front is not directly connected to the main part or we can use the knife tool again. 
          This time we do want to cut trough all objects, so adjust the settings in the tool menu. Make sure to cut it from the 
          ortographic front side to get a straight cut. After cutting the object we can now delete the side that we have not yet manipulated. 
          Just delete the edges and vertices, you don't have to worry about them. To mirror our progress to the other side, we want to 
          create an empty axis object and add it to WALL-E, I will call it the "Wall-E Origin". It has to be in the center point. Now that 
          we have defined this point we can go to our Body half and add the mirror modifier, select the Origin point as the mirror object 
          and select the Y axis to mirror. If you want to make sure that both of the sides will merge together you can go into the 
          edit mode, select the according view option in the modifier selection and increase the merge value until both halves met at 
          the center. If your object is done, go into the object mode again and apply the modifier. Now we have finished both sides.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we are going to have a look at the back, we want to add some details at the corners of the Body. Therefore we add a cube, 
          scale it tiny and color it with the "Metal" color. Try to place the cube so that roughly a quarter of it is placed inside the 
          yellow Body. After placing it we want to extend the three sides to cover the Body according to the images of the orthographic 
          views. Select each face individually and extrude it. To get some round corners we want to use the bevel tool now. Select the 
          edges at the outside of our detail object and use the shortcut <strong>CTRL + B</strong> to add beveling. You can scroll with 
          the mouse wheel to get a finer partitioning. Click with the left mouse button to finalize it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished this corner, we can use our mirroring trick again. Go into the object mode and select the mirror 
          modifier for our detail, you can use the same Origin point we defined before. This time we want to mirror two times, along 
          the X and Y axis to get our four details at the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the details at the top of the Body we can use a similar strategy as we just did. You may want to pause the video now and 
          try it for yourself to test your learned skills. We will proceed in a second.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only difference at the top detail is that we want to create a slightly different form and only mirror it once. Create a 
          new cube and repeat the same steps as before to position it at one of the corners. Now we want to select the faces again and 
          extrude them according to the images. This time the line we see at the side view is connecting the front corner with the back. 
          Extrude the detail at the end twice so that we have a new cube-shaped end at the other corner. This will make it easier to 
          extrude the remaining directions. You can move the points manually with the XRay option on if you want to position them more 
          accuratly. At the end we use the same bevel technique as before and mirror our detail again with the Origin point. At the end 
          you can apply all modifiers and join the objects together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we turn our attention to the back side. We can see that the middle parts are just basic shapes of cylinders and cubes. 
          The most detailed pieces are the side objects which we are going to start with. Again we use cubes as the base object, scale 
          it and position it roughly on top of where we want to create our model piece. If we now go into the side view we can move the 
          points of the cube in the positions we want. make sure to have the X-Ray option on to select and move the points at the front 
          and back of the cube together. One way to achieve this rounded shape is to use the bevel tool again on the one vertice that 
          lies between the sharp points. Bascially we are using this point as a control point to create a curve shape. If you are not 
          happy with your shape you can move the control point around until you roughly macth the reference image. For the bottom line 
          we want to do the same thing, but we are missing a control point. To create a new one you can either manually divide the edges 
          or just use the knife or loop cut tool, I decided on the loop cut here. Since we now have a new control point, we can do the 
          same thing as before, moving our control point and then using bevel to create our curve shape. At this point I already mirror 
          our object, you don't have to do it now but you may. I just wanted to see how it looks here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at the reference image we have achieved the outer shape, now we want to concentrate on the inner details. The first 
          thing we want to create is the inner curve which is parallel to the outer one. In this instance we can use the Inset tool 
          with the shortcut <strong>I</strong> after selcting the face we want to modify, this will create the inner shape we are 
          interested in. Don't worry about the weird looking shape it will create for now. This probably occurs here because of the 
          sharp edges which make problems. At this point I checked to apply all transformations to our object with <strong>CTRL+A</strong> 
          because sometimes the scaling interfers with the Inset tool. Since this didn't help I accepted the weird shape and fixed the 
          object manually. All the edges and vertices we do not need and were created extra, we can dissolve by selecting the vertices, 
          clicking the right mouse button and click on dissolve. So the only thing remaining is the shape we are interest in. Then I 
          finished the curve manually by using the knife tool again. The only thing left to do now is to use the knife tool for the 
          rest of the object, cutting the straight lines according to the reference image. Always select the relevant faces before and 
          check the tool menu so that we only cut on the one side of the object. If you do not want to select the faces individually 
          each time, you can use <strong>C</strong> to use a round selection tool. So you can basically draw a selection. When you 
          finished cutting the lines, we can color the faces accordingly by assigning the "Metal" color again, and then using Extrude 
          in the end to move the yellow faces inwards. After applying a mirror this object is done.
        </p>
        <p>
          All left to to on the back is to create the missing cubes and cylinders according to the images. For the cylinder object we 
          introduce a new red color and using the "Metal" color for the end parts again. You can use the mirror modifier here again 
          or just copy the object to the other side. Watch out when copying: All the colors attached to it we be copied too, so you 
          have to manually select the original color again. The safer way would be to duplicate the object with <strong>Shift + D</strong>, 
          then the colors should remain the same. In the end you can join everything together again.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of this session we have a look again at the front side of the object to add some missing details. We want to create 
          the interface on the metal chest piece and the indentations on the middle part. Starting with the display we can create a new 
          cube, scale it down and create a new color for it, the "Rust_Metal" which I will for now just color a bit darker than the normal 
          "Metal", you can mirror it to the other side here or duplicate it. For all the pieces here make sure that the objects overlap 
          inside of the objects behind it so that there will be no space in between. For the display I also make sure that the display 
          is really flat, so that you can not see it from the side. The next details will be the black display parts for which we 
          introduce a new color "Display_black". Here again you should use duplicate with <strong>Shift + D</strong> instead of copying 
          like me because than I have to make sure that I check the colors again. For the yellow parts we do the same thing as before 
          but introducing the new color "Display_Yellow", for the bottom parts you may want to use the Array Modifier, so you don't 
          have to duplicate each item individually. You only want to offset the items hower on the Z axis so that they will all stick 
          to the display.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we want to to create the circular parts: First create a  new cylinder for the red button, you can introduce the new color 
          "Display_Red". The button should stick out however compared to the items before. After that we create a yellow display part, 
          not sticking out. However you will notice that there is a difference to the reference, we still have to cut out a hole in the 
          middle. To do that we want to create a new cylinder and place it where we want to cut out, than we use the Boolean modifier 
          on the outer circle to subtract the inner one. After applying the modifier you can delete the inner cylinder again to make 
          the hole visible. Now the display part is done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we only want to introduce some indentations on the front of the Body. For that we can use a cube again and use the same 
          technique as with the cylinders just now. You want to use the Array modifier to create three similar cubes at once. Here 
          again is a chance to try this part yourself as we have seen all relevant techniques before. We will proceed in a second.
        </p>
        <p>
          The solution can be seen now. After applying the modifiers, and deleting the cubes you have to assign the yellow color again 
          to the holes as they may be painted white now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now you can combine all the remaining objects within the robot together via join so that it is finished for now. Next time 
          we are going to prepare the wheels of the robot.
        </p>
